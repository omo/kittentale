Kitten is for WebKitten. This place is for some randm folklore that I
heared, saw or made at the WebKit land. Some will be technical, others won't.

Here is how this comes here:
I am a big fun of [Evan Martin](http://neugierig.org/) and his writings, 
especially his [Chromium Notes](http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/).
But he [leaves the project](http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2012/02/the-end.html) and stopped writing it.
This is sad for me. At the same time, an idea comes to my mind - Can I do something similar?

The idea comes with two bad news though.
Bad news part one is that I'm not familiar with Chromium.
But fortunately, I know a few about WebKit that I can talk about. 
Bad news part two is that my writing is far behind Evan's. Well, that is that.
I can at least type some words in almost gramatically correct way. Let me just hope it somehow work.

This note is never compehensive nor authorative, might not be even
informative because I'm not an ultra expert of the subject.  I'm
relatively new in the community - I've been working on WebKit since
the beginning of 2010. It's shorter than a quater of the project history.

Also, I'll write this for myself, for my friends and for my team
mates. If you find nothing interesting or relevant here, it's not my
fault, yours neither. It just means you aren't my audience.
(For someone who can read Japanese: I also write
[here](http://steps.dodgson.org/). It might be more interesting.)

Why Tokyo?
-----------

As you imagined, I live in Tokyo and work from that city.
There are a few interesting bits around the fact. 
WebKit you PST kittens see might be different from what I'm seeing.
I'll write about that someday - if I can keep writing.
